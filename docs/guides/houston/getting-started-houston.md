# Houston Quick-Start

Whether you're a seasoned Node Operator, rETH holder or curious onlooker, this page will help you get started with exploring the new features included in Houston.


## Initializing Voting Power:

First and foremost, the most important step if you are **Node Operator** is to [initialize voting](../houston/participate#initializing-voting) to unlock your voting power. Nodes who've initialized voting are included when the network's total voting power is calculated. 

At the genesis of Houston, pDAO voting is disabled until a sufficient number of nodes have initialized voting. This is to prevent rogue proposals from passing while total voting power and quorum is low. After enough nodes have initialized voting, a switch will be flipped and pDAO will have the helm. 

To initialize voting power, use this command in the smartnode: 
```shell
rocketpool pdao initialize-voting
```
You only need to do this once. Initializing voting will ensure that your node's voting power is included in future on-chain proposals and allow you to vote on them.
